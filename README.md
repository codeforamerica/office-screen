Office Screen
=============

We have big monitors hanging in the office. In the past, they’ve had
[Tweetbeam](http://www.tweetbeam.com/show?query=codeforamerica) on them most
of the time, but there are other relevant things to add to the rotation.

These are them.

Rotation

Pull requests welcome. Generally each file here is a simple HTML frameset
with a refresh tag for rotation.
